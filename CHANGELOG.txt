Breaking changes:

- Renamed `:re-db/sync-tx` to `:re-db.sync/tx` for consistency

- in re-db.sync.client:
  - renamed `on-handshake!` to `on-open`
  - renamed `$query` to `$watch`
  - removed `all`
  - `$watch`, ``$all` now take `channel` as 1st parameter
  - messages are no longer queued before connection. We already keep track of active queries and re-initialize
    on re-connect, this should be sufficient.
  - added `on-close` fn for clean-up
  - removed `transact-txs`
- moved transit code to `re-db.sync.transit`
- moved diffing code to `re-db.sync.entity-diff-1`
- `re-db.subscriptions/subscription` accepts optional not-found parameter,
  otherwise throws if id is not registered.
